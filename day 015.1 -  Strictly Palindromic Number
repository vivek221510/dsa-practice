/*
leetcode - 2396. Strictly Palindromic Number
---------------------------------

Problem Statement:
An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 (inclusive),
the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1:
Input: n = 9
Output: false
Explanation:
Base 2: 9 = 1001 (palindromic)
Base 3: 9 = 100 (not palindromic)
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: false
Explanation:
Base 2: 4 = 100 (not palindromic)
Therefore, 4 is not strictly palindromic.

------------------------------------------------------------

Constraints:
4 <= n <= 10^5

------------------------------------------------------------

Intuition:
- For any n >= 5, consider base (n - 2).
- In that base:
    n = 1 Ã— (n - 2) + 2
  So its representation becomes "12", which is NOT a palindrome.
- For n = 4, in base 2, representation = "100" (also not a palindrome).
- Therefore, no integer >= 4 is strictly palindromic.

------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:
- Since the problem guarantees 4 <= n <= 1e5,
  the answer is always false.

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

    public boolean isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        return false;  // No integer >= 4 is strictly palindromic
