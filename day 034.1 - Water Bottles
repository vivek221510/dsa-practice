1518. Water Bottles

We keep drinking all available full bottles and count them.  
Each empty bottle is collected, and whenever we have enough to exchange, we trade them for new full bottles.  
This process continues until no more exchanges can be made.

class Solution {
    public int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans = 0;
        int empty = 0;

        while (numBottles > 0) {
            ans += numBottles;
            empty += numBottles;
            numBottles = 0;

            if (empty >= numExchange) {
                numBottles = empty / numExchange;
                empty = empty % numExchange;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(numBottles / numExchange)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
