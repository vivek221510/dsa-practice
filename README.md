# 🚀 Daily DSA Practice

This repository is my personal log of **Daily DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) practice**.  
I upload the problems I solve on a regular basis to keep track of my consistency and progress.

---

## 📌 About
- Problems come from different platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, etc.).  
- The uploads are not strictly structured — this is more of a **practice archive** than a curated set.  
- Code is focused on solving the problem first; may or may not include extra comments/optimizations.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Maintain a habit of **daily problem solving**.  
- Track my journey and improvement in DSA.  
- Build confidence for coding interviews and contests.  

---

## 🛠️ Note
Since this is a practice repo:  
- You might find repeated problems with different approaches.  
- File names may directly reflect the problem name or platform ID.  
- The goal is **consistency > perfection**.

✨ This repo is not meant to be a polished library, but a **practice log**.  
Consistency today = Stronger skills tomorrow 🚀
