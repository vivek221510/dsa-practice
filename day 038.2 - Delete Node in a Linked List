### 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

Given access to only a node in a singly linked list (not the head), delete that node from the list.  
You are guaranteed that the node to be deleted is **not the tail** of the list.

---

**Example:**
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;   // Copy next node's value into current node
        node.next = node.next.next; // Skip the next node
    }
}
```
