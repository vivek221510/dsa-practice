# 🔹 Problem: Max Operations on Binary String

You are given a binary string `s`.  
You need to count the number of operations where each operation happens whenever you encounter a pattern `"10"`, and the cost added is equal to how many `'1'` characters have appeared before that `'0'`.

Your task is to compute the total number of such operations.

---

## 🔸 Example

**Input:**  
`s = "11010"`

**Walkthrough:**  
- At index 1 (`s[1] == '1'`), ones = 2  
- At index 2 (`s[2] == '0'` after `'1'`), add ones → +2  
- At index 3 (`s[3] == '1'`), ones = 3  
- At index 4 (`s[4] == '0'` after `'1'`), add ones → +3  

**Output:**  
`5`

## 🔹 Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  — Single pass through the string  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  — Only counters used

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int ans = 0;
        int ones = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                ones++;
                if (s.charAt(i + 1) == '0') {
                    ans += ones;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
