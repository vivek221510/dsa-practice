💡 Problem: Leetcode 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

📘 Description:
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

- Every Monday, he deposits a new amount of money.
- On Monday, he deposits `1` dollar, Tuesday `2`, Wednesday `3`, …, and Sunday `7`.
- Every next week, the amount deposited on each day increases by $1 compared to the previous week.
  (e.g., Monday of week 2 = $2, Tuesday = $3, …)

Given an integer `n`, return the total money Hercy will have in the Leetcode bank after `n` days.

🔹 Example:
Input: n = 10  
Output: 37  
Explanation:
Week 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28  
Week 2: 2 + 3 + (only first 3 days used) = 9  
Total = 28 + 9 = 37

🔹 Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 1000

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)
💾 Space Complexity: O(1)
