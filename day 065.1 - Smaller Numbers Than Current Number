# 🧮 LeetCode: Smaller Numbers Than Current Number

### 📘 Problem Description
You are given an integer array `nums`.  
For each element in the array, count how many numbers in the array are smaller than it.

Return the answer as an array.

### 🔍 Example
**Input:**  
`nums = [8, 1, 2, 2, 3]`

**Output:**  
`[4, 0, 1, 1, 3]`

**Explanation:**  
- 8 has 4 smaller numbers: 1, 2, 2, and 3.  
- 1 has 0 smaller numbers.  
- 2 has 1 smaller number: 1.  
- 3 has 3 smaller numbers: 1, 2, and 2.

### 🧠 Approach
We use a **nested loop** to compare every element with every other element.  
For each number, we count how many numbers are smaller than it.

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity
- **O(n²)** — Two nested loops (compare every element with every other).
  
### 💾 Space Complexity
- **O(n)** — For storing the result array.

### 💻 Full Solution Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                    ans[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
