🔹 Problem: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful
----------------------------------------------
You are given a string `colors` and an integer array `neededTime` of the same length.
`colors[i]` represents the color of the i-th balloon, and `neededTime[i]` is the time needed to remove that balloon.

You want the rope (string) to be colorful — i.e., no two adjacent balloons have the same color.
To achieve this, you may remove some balloons, and the cost is the sum of `neededTime` values for removed balloons.

Return the minimum total time needed to make the rope colorful.

----------------------------------------------
Example:
Input:
colors = "abaac"
neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Remove the balloon at index 2 (color 'a' with time 3).
Now the rope becomes "abac" — no adjacent balloons share the same color.

----------------------------------------------
🧠 Approach:
We iterate through the string while grouping consecutive identical colors.
For each group, remove all balloons except the one with the maximum `neededTime`.

1️⃣ Traverse the string.
2️⃣ If two adjacent colors are the same, accumulate their total time.
3️⃣ Keep track of the maximum time in that group.
4️⃣ Subtract that maximum once (since that balloon stays).
5️⃣ Add the remaining total time to `sum`.

----------------------------------------------
⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)
🧮 Space Complexity: O(1)

✅ Code Implementation:
*/

class Solution {
    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = neededTime.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (colors.charAt(i) == colors.charAt(i + 1)) {
                int max = neededTime[i];
                sum += neededTime[i];
                while (i < n - 1 && colors.charAt(i) == colors.charAt(i + 1)) {
                    max = Math.max(max, neededTime[i + 1]);
                    sum += neededTime[i + 1];
                    i++;
                }
                sum -= max;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
